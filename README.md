I am a software developer and mathematician, who is looking for an internship or a junior developer position to gain experience.

As a programmer and problem solver, I am flexible but structured. I have experience with most areas of computer science - from machine learning to computer architecture and from numerical methods to optimisation. Additionally, I quickly pick up new skills, and enjoy exploration.

I thrive in an environment where I can develop my skills, and where I develop solutions that help others.

In my free time, I enjoy tabletop games, playing the piano, and baking. I have also recently started brewing wine.

A selection of projects that I have worked on are:
- An [itinerary planner](https://github.com/erla2996/UIP2), written in javascript and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The project is an exercise in user interface design.
- A [solar system model and visualisation](https://github.com/erla2996/SolarSystem), written in javascript and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The project is a hobby project, undertaken in order to deepen my knowledge of Three.js, as well as the challenges of simulating a solar system.
