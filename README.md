A selection of projects that I have worked on are:
- An [itinerary planner](https://github.com/erla2996/UIP2), written in javascript and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The project is an exercise in user interface design.
- A [solar system model and visualisation](https://github.com/erla2996/SolarSystem), written in javascript and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The project is a hobby project, undertaken in order to deepen my knowledge of Three.js, as well as the challenges of simulating a solar system.
